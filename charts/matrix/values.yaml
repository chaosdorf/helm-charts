  # Options:
  #   DaemonSet:  A DaemonSet will be used to schedule one Coturn pod per node. Each Coturn pod will open the ports it needs directly on the host it is scheduled on.
  #               This maximizes compatibility and will allow you to set up Coturn without any additional cluster configuration.
  #   Deployment: A Deployment will be used to schedule Coturn pods. The number of Coturn pods will be configurable (via the replicaCount setting below).
  #               You will need to use a NodePort service or an external load balancer to route traffic to the Coturn pods.
  #               This is more flexible and can use fewer pods in a multi-node setup, but will require additional networking configuration.

    #   NodePort:  Recommended for Deployment configurations. This will open TURN ports on every node and route traffic on these ports to the Coturn pods.
    #              You will need to make sure your cloud provider supports the cluster config setting "apiserver.service-node-port-range", as this range must contain
    #              the ports defined above for the service to be created.
